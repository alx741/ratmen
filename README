`ratmen' is a program derived from `ratmenu' (although some code was copied and
pasted directly from its parent "9menu"). This program is intended for use with
ratpoison, but I guess it'll work fine with 9wm and other similarly-minded
window managers.

Basically this program does what ratmenu does, only better.

You may set up preferences in ~/.Xresources, without all that tedious mucking
about with longish command line options. Menus that does not fit on screen are
scrollable. Menu can die when window is unfocused.

For scripting, selected choices may be output to standard out, instead of
executed as commands. Any item (not just the first) may be selected, when
opening a menu.

For more info, see the POD documentation in the source code (it can be
extracted using `pod2text ratmen.c').

For this and other programs see: http://zrajm.klingonska.org/~programs/

`ratmen' is pretty much abandoned nowadays (though I hope one day to get back
to it). I've also written a program called `termmen', which does pretty much
the same thing in the terminal/console, but which is far comfortable to use
with large menus, and have better (more less-ish, with incremental search,
goto-line, etc) ways of navigating around.

If I ever get the chance to revisit this project on a grander scale, I would
merge these two programs into one, completely (re-?)written in C, for
efficiency. Should anyone out there find this a worthy cause, I can probably be
convinced of doing this sooner, rather than later (esp. with some amount of
help for writing the C code).
