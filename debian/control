Description: Creates X menus from the shell.
 This is ratmenu, a simple program that allows you to create X menus from
 the shell.  It was forked from 9menu version 1.5, to provide specific support
 for the ratpoison window manager.  Where 9menu only responds to the mouse,
 and ignores the keyboard, ratmenu has all mouse sensitivity taken out, and only
 responds to the keyboard.  Although designed for ratpoison, it will work with
 any ICCCM compliant window manager.
