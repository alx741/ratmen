VMENU
=====

Is a [ratmen](http://zrajm.org/programs/) fork, which is a program derived from
*ratmenu* with some of the code from the parent *9menu* program.

**VMENU** allows you to create X menus from the shell, so you can create
tailored menus from scripts for various purposes.

Very handy when using tiling window managers like ratpoison and others.


Examples
--------

You can checkout some scripts I've written that use **VMENU** from my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/alx741/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/.scripts/ratpoison).

Specifically the [Clipboard
stack](http://silly-bytes.blogspot.com/2015/11/ratpoison-clipboard-stack.html)
and the [Music
control](http://silly-bytes.blogspot.com/2015/10/ratpoison-music-control.html).


Configuration
-------------

**VMENU** set preferences from the standard `~/.Xresources` file that you
probably have already configured for other X programs.

Take my
[.Xresources](https://github.com/alx741/dotfiles/blob/master/urxvt/.Xresources)
file as example.

**VMENU** settings can be changed on execution using the appropriate command
line arguments, checkout the man page for more about it.
